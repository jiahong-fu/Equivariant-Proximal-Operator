## Deraining Experiments



### Dependenices
* (More detail See [rcd_torch1.0.yaml](rcd_torch1.0.yaml))
A suitable [conda](https://conda.io/) environment named `rcd_torch1.0` can be created and activated with:

```
conda env create -f rcd_torch1.0.yaml
conda activate rcd_torch1.0
```

### Pretrained Models
The Pretrained equivariant proximal based models of RCDNet_EB is available as [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1-gb8gvb9Z_QwpQI_0CR5Bw) (Password: dk2a). Download the models to [Pretrained Model](./Pretrained%20Model/)

### Dataset & Training & Testing
Please refer to the original coding framework [RCDNet](https://github.com/hongwang01/RCDNet) to execute the training and testing process.
